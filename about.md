## The Manifest

Years ago, I was just another script-kiddy in Jogjakarta, documenting my "programming journey" like a lost traveler counting trees in a forest. I spent my days at **42Paris**, a place designed to break your spirit and rebuild it with pure `C` and a healthy dose of nihilism.

I used to claim I spent my time on "no sense activities." I wasn't lying. But eventually, i realized that being a jerk was not a good life style.

### Evolution: Code to "idk i'm doing rn"

I’ve decided to stop pretending I’m a corporate-ready robot and leaned into the chaos of being a **Solo Game Dev & Artist**. I’m currently in that sweet spot where my code is a crime against humanity and my art looks like it was recovered from a cursed hard drive. 

It turns out that "becoming an artist" is just a fancy way of saying I spend eight hours scrolling abyssal shit such as AI generated content. I’ve traded my sanity for the ability to build worlds that are as broken as our economy.

### Legacy & Artifacts
* **[42ctf.org](https://www.42ctf.org)**: In 2019, I spawned this CTF platform to give 42 students and InfoSec masochists a place to sharpen their blades. It’s still out there, lurking in the shadows *sound of a dark mage skeleton in minecraft or something like that idk i don't play minecraft*.

* **The Repository**: My GitHub is a graveyard of half-finished masterpieces and "temporary" fixes that became permanent.
